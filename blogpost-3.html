            <p>Why do we live, if not to die? Many have pondered this question throught time from
                Plato to Marcus Aurelius to modern day philosophers...so whats the point?
            </p>
            <p>
                Today we will examine what history and philosophers say about why we live and the purpose of life
                because without this answer how could we possibly be motivated to do anything?
            </p>

            <b><p>“A man’s true delight is to do the things he was made for.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</p></b>

            <p>What does it mean to do the things we were made for in this ever evolving world? Two thousand years ago, 
                The Roman emperor and often called Stoic King, Marcus Aurelius pondered this question and came to the 
                conclusion that we should live through virtue as it is within our nature and rather than seeking external validation,
                 we must look within. Today career counselors face many of the same issues in helping people develop their own path in this
                 changing landscape of the world.</p>

            <p>For the stoics, purpose was not found in a job title or in a plan or in pleasing others, but in living virtuously, in alignment
                 with nature and reason. The stoics taught that everyone is part of a larger plan, like the cell in a body it is created for some
                  purpose which it excels at. As Marcus Aurelius wrote, “Whatever is in accord with you is in accord with the world.” Your job then
                   is to focus on what choices align with yourself and the nature of all things. This means doing the things you’re passionate about
                    and allowing yourself to excel, this may be teaching, making money from fishing, or whatever else fulfills your purpose. We aren’t
                     looking for fame or prestige but integrity and when you act with these beliefs and in accordance with nature, you’ll find that you
                      succeed in most matters of life.</p>

        <p>Steven Pressfield, in The War of Art within the introduction says something like this: a woman believes she has six months to live because of cancer. She stops everything she was doing with her life, quits her job, leaves the pointless things behind and starts dedicating her work to what she's always been wanting to do and has never been happier. As Marcus Aurelius reminds us that “you could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.” We shouldn’t wait till we are at death's door to focus on our purpose.</p>
